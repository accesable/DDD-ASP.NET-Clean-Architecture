# Clean Architecture & Domain-Driven Design in ASP.NET REST API

![DDD](Docs/images/ddd_layers.png)
1. DDD emphasizes placing the domain model at the center of the design. This means that the core business logic and rules are expressed directly within the domain model.
2. Users of the system interact primarily with the domain model, which encapsulates the business concepts and processes. They don't need to concern themselves with the underlying technologies used to implement these functionalities.
3. DDD allows for a clear separation between the domain logic and the infrastructure or technical details. This means that changes to the infrastructure or technology stack can be made without affecting the core business logic, and vice versa.
4. DDD also enables the creation of a ubiquitous language shared by domain experts and developers, ensuring that the domain model accurately reflects the language and concepts of the business domain.
> "In Domain-Driven Design (DDD), the focus is on placing the domain logic at the core of the architecture, where the domain model defines the business rules and processes. Users interact primarily with this domain model, abstracted from the underlying technologies. DDD enables a separation of concerns, allowing for changes in infrastructure or technology without impacting the core domain logic, and vice versa. Additionally, it promotes the use of a ubiquitous language shared by domain experts and developers to accurately represent the business domain."

> Domain-Driven Design (DDD) serves as a bridge between software architecture and business solutions. It provides a set of principles, patterns, and practices that help developers design software systems that accurately reflect the complexities of the business domain they are working with.

> By focusing on modeling the domain and its concepts within the software, DDD enables developers to create systems that are more aligned with the needs and requirements of the business. This alignment not only enhances communication between technical and non-technical stakeholders but also leads to more maintainable and adaptable software over time.

> So, DDD sits at the intersection of software architecture and business solutions, leveraging architectural concepts to solve business problems effectively.
